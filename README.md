# FOSS Publishing
Welcome to your FOSS-Org and thank you for wanting to publish your project.
You already made it this far, so you probably know about all the helpful documentation, 
but in case you ended up here by lucky accident or you need a quick reminder, you can find all the info on how to proceed with your project and the actual publishing [here]()

All FOSS-publishing Orgs need certain settings and the CLA Assistant. Also the license needs to be set. Pull requests are mendatory.

This README's only purpose is to make you aware of the presets and to welcome you to your new repository. 
Please replace this README with your own, as soon as you get started.
